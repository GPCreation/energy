                        design and electric powertrain. Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a

                                The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S.
                                The Model X has an
                                EPA size class as an SUV,[7] and shares ~30% of its content with the Model S, half

                                capable of 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds,[2][3] which would be quicker
                                than any street legal
                                production car as of the announcement in 2017.[4] The Roadster is the successor to
