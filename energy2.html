            energy
            in the process of transfer from one body to another. After it has been transferred, energy is always
            designated
            according to its nature. Hence, heat transferred may become thermal energy, while work done may manifest
            itself

                        An electric car is powered by an electric motor instead of a petrol engine. The electric motor
                        gets energy from
                        a controller, which regulates the amount of power—based on the driver’s use of an accelerator
                        pedal. The
                        electric car (also known as electric vehicle or EV) uses energy stored in its rechargeable
                        batteries, which are
                        recharged by common household electricity.

                        Thus an electric vehicle will have three basic components :
                        Energy Storage Unit
                        Controller
                        Propulsion system

                        The energy storage unit will have a way to store power. A chemical battery is the most common
                        energy storage
                        technology currently, although it can be different - for example - A fuel cell (which gets its
                        electricity from
                        hydrogen rather than a battery pack), can be used instead of a chemical battery as the energy
                        storage unit.
                        The controller acts as a pipeline or gateway to the electric motor.. The controller will do
                        other things too -
                        it moderates the power, will also act as a converter - converts power from DC to AC, or it might
                        also increase
                        or decrease the amperage etc. The controller is the brains of the system.
                        The electric motor, which is the propulsion system, converts the electric power and converts
                        this into physical
                        energy for movement.

                                        Compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are
                                        quieter, have no exhaust emissions, and lower emissions overall.[1] In the
                                        United States and the European Union, as of 2020, the total cost of ownership of
                                        recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ICE cars, due to

                                        network connectivity, while others are more basic.

                                        Charging stations are also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and
                                        are
                                        provided in municipal
                                        parking locations by electric utility companies or at retail shopping centers by
                                        private
                                        companies.
                                        These stations provide special connectors that conform to the variety of
                                        electric
                                        charging connector
                                        standards.

                                        Fees for using EVSE vary from monthly or yearly flat rates to per-kWh to hourly
                                        rates.
                                        Charging stations
                                        can be free and are usually subsidized by the local government.

                                        Different types of EVSE provide different speeds of charging. Level 1 charging
                                        stations
                                        use a 120 volt
                                        (V), alternating-current (AC) plug and require a dedicated circuit, offering
                                        about 5
                                        miles of range for
                                        every hour of charging. Level 2 stations charge through a 240V, AC plug and
                                        require home
                                        charging or
                                        public charging equipment to be installed. Level 2 stations provide 10 to 20
                                        miles of
                                        range for every
                                        hour of charging. Level 2 chargers are the most common and charge at
                                        approximately the
                                        same rate as a
                                        home system.

                                        Level 3 chargers are also known as DC fast chargers. Level 3 uses a 480V,
                                        direct-current
                                        (DC) plug. They
                                        bypass the onboard charger and provide DC electricity to the battery via a
                                        special
                                        charging port. DC
                                        Fast Chargers provide up to 40 miles of range for every 10 minutes of charging
                                        but are
                                        not compatible
                                        with all vehicles. Additionally, some propriety charging stations, such as the
                                        Tesla
                                        Supercharger, are
                                        designed for significantly higher-speed charging.

                                        As demand grows for more publicly accessible charging stations, there is a
                                        greater need
                                        for equipment
                                        that supports faster charging at higher voltages and currents that are not
                                        currently
                                        available from
                                        residential ESVE. Globally, the number of electric vehicle networks is
                                        increasing to
                                        provide a system of
                                        publicly accessible charging stations for EV recharging. Governments, automakers
                                        and
                                        charging
                                        infrastructure providers have forged agreements to create these networks.
